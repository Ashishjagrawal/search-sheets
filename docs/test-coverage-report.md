## Coverage Analysis

### ✅ Well-Covered Areas
1. **Search Service** (93.64%) - Core search functionality is thoroughly tested
2. **Excel Parser** (85.17%) - File parsing logic has good coverage
3. **Embedding Service** (84.4%) - AI integration is well tested
4. **Search Routes** (89.28%) - API endpoints are well covered

### ⚠️ Areas Needing Improvement
1. **Sheets Routes** (51.82%) - File upload functionality needs more tests
2. **Status Routes** (47.36%) - System monitoring needs better coverage
3. **Label Service** (56.59%) - AI labeling logic needs more edge case testing

### ❌ Areas with No Coverage
1. **Cache Service** (0%) - Caching functionality not tested
2. **Formula Parser** (0%) - Excel formula parsing not tested
3. **Utility Scripts** (0%) - Evaluation and ingestion scripts not tested
4. **Service Index** (0%) - Service initialization not tested

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Add tests for Cache Service** - Critical for performance
2. **Add tests for Formula Parser** - Core functionality for Excel processing
3. **Improve Sheets Routes coverage** - File upload is a key feature

### Medium Priority
1. **Add error handling tests** - Many uncovered lines are error scenarios
2. **Add integration tests for scripts** - Evaluation and ingestion workflows
3. **Improve Label Service coverage** - AI functionality needs more testing

### Low Priority
1. **Add service initialization tests** - Service index and startup logic
2. **Add more edge case tests** - Complex heuristic logic

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Test Reliability**: 100% (All tests pass consistently)
- **Test Speed**: Good (Most tests complete quickly)
- **Test Maintainability**: High (Well-structured test files)
- **Mock Quality**: Excellent (Comprehensive mocking strategy)

## Coverage Goals

| Module | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Overall | 45.82% | 70% | High |
| Backend Routes | 61.28% | 80% | High |
| Backend Services | 73.49% | 85% | Medium |
